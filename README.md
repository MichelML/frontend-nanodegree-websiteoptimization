## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Our challenge was to optimize [this online portfolio](https://github.com/MichelML/frontend-nanodegree-websiteoptimization) for speed! In particular, we needed to optimize the critical rendering path and make these pages render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques we have picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

More specifically, there were two parts to the projet: 
1. Optimize [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=en) score for index.html. 
2. Optimize Frames Per Second in pizza.html (see views folder).
